						<h5>History</h5>
						<p> In 1982, the local community began a small harvest festival to showcase the areaâ€™s diverse agricultural products. With heavy involvement from Cornell 
						and a partnership with downtown merchants including David Abdulky and Lyle McCartney, the event was strictly a farmers market.
						Over time, the addition of food and craft vendors, games, and other activities for children grew the event into what it is today.</p>
